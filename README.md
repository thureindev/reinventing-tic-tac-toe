## Reinventing Classic Tic-Tac-Toe in New Gameplay

Hello, future employers and hiring managers. 

This is my personal project to level up my programming skills after a period of self-reflection. I’ve been building apps, learning as I go, and applying that knowledge to build more cool stuff. Check out [my progress on GitHub](https://github.com/thureindev/progress) and see what I’ve been up to!

Thanks for stopping by!
